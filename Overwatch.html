<h1 style="color:Orange;">Backround</h1> 
<p style="color:White;"><b>Overwatch was made by Blizzard Entertainment, and was released worldwide on May 24, 2016 and so far has been considered one of the<br>
  best games of 2016! Overwatch is a team-based first person shooter(FPS), with over 30 million people who play it world-wide. The game<br>
  has won over 100 game of the year awards, and has a large cast of 25 characters to chose from so far, each character with its own<br>
  rich backstory in the Overwatch universe.

  <p style="color:White;">The world of overwatch is a world set far in the future, holograms, robotic companions called omncs,<br> 
  the whole shabam. For a long time the omnics and humans lived together mostly peaceful, some people thought that omnics were less than humans,<br> 
  and tried to rally against them. This after a while, caused the biggest upset of there time, the Omnic Crisis. Omnics and humans were at war.<br> 
  Soon after, Overwatch was created, Overwatch was an elite task force of heros created to fight off the omnics and celebrate peace. During the war,<br> 
  many people and omnics died until eventually the humans won. Peace was then rebuilt, but after the omnic crisis the original people who distrusted<br> 
  the omnics now trusted them even less, which eventually lead to the 2nd omnic crisis, which is still currently going on in the universe.</b>

  <h2 style="color:Orange;">The Game</h2>
  <p style="color:White;"><b>In overwatch you play a hero with 5 other players, making a team of six to battle the enemy team (also a team of six), on various maps that are<br>
  located all over the world. Each hero has its own abilities and what is called an ultimant which is a super strong ability that can only be used once<br>
  and takes a long time to recharge. The goal in the game is to acomplish the goal of each map, whether is be pusing a payoad throught narrowing corodors,<br>
  or capturing a control point their will always be an objetive you must complete for each map. My personal favorite maps, are “Oasis, ” a control<br>
  point map located in a desert in Saudia Arabia and the map Eichenwalde, which is a large castle in germany.

  <p style="color:White;"><b>In the game, characters can be classified<br> 
  under 4 classes, Assault, Defense, Tank, and Support. The Assualt class belongs to a number of a high damage high mobility characters with low health,<br>
    making them the glass-cannons of the group.</b></p>

    <p style="color:White;"><b>The Defense class, belongs to characters that are amazing at defending the objective, and shutting down the<br>
      enemy before they can even get to the objective.</b></p>

    <p style="color:White;"><b>The Tank class belongs to characters with high health, and a way to protect their team from damage, like<br>
  one tank character has a large barrier sheld. Some of the tanks also have an ability that allows you to move or stun the enemy team, which is known as crowd<br>
      contol or cc for short.</b></p>

    <p style="color:White;"><b>The support class is probably the most important class of all, they keep your team alive. The support characters heal and boost your<br>
   characters, while also disabling the enemy team.</b></p>

  <h3 style="color:Orange;">Closing Thoughts</h3>
  <p style="color:White;"><b>Overwatch is a great game, not only for its spot on gameplay, realistic art style, but once you have bought the game, it can be played completely free to play,<br>
  because the only things you can buy are skins and cosmetics, so the game is completely skill dependent. Overwatch costs 40 dollars for the standard editon, however<br>
  the game of the year and origins editions which provide limited edition skins as soon as you get the game costs extra, bringing the price up to 60 dollars. In conclusion,<br>
  overwatch is an amazing game and is one of my personal favorites, if you buy this game, be prepared for endless hours of gameplay and fun!</b></p>
