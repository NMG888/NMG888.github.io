<h1>Backround</h1>
<p>Overwatch was made by Blizzard Entertainment, and was released worldwide on May 24, 2016<br> and so far has been considered one of the best games of 2016! Overwatch is a team-based first<br> person shooter(FPS), with over 30 million people who play it world-wide. The game has won<br> over 100 game of the year awards, and has a large cast of 25 characters to chose from so far<br> , each character with its own rich backstory in the Overwatch universe. In overwatch you play with 5 other players, making a team of six to battle the enemy team (also a team of six), on various maps that are located all over the world. My personal favorite maps, are “Oasis, ” which is located in the arabian desert of Iraq and the map Eichenwalde, which is a large castle in germany. The game costs 40 dollars for the standard editon, however the game of the year and origins editions costs extra, bringing the price up to 60 dollars, but the price is worth it. In conclusion, overwatch is an amazing game and is one of my personal favorites, if you buy this game, be prepared for endless hours of gameplay and fun!
