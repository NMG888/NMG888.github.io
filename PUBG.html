<h1>Backround</h1> 
<p>PlayerUnkown's BattleGrounds or PUBG is a TPS(Third-Person-Shooter) and was released on March 23, 2017 by
  Bluehole. Inc, and has been an instant success, with currently over 19.5 million players, PUBG has
  the most downloads on Steam (a gaming platform for pc), has a five star rating, and can be played
  endlessly. PUBG is a king of the hill battle royale and was one of the first of its kind in the now
  booming Battle Royale gaming establishment. The game unfortuanantly has no lore behind it, but it is
  the realistic game-play and the unique-ness of it that makes it an absolute blast to play.</p>
  
  <h1>The Game</h1>
  <p>At the start of every PUBG game, you start in a plane with 100 other players, that is flying over
     a reasonabley sized island, this is your battle field. Across the island there are several deserted
    towns and buildings.</p>

     <p>In the buildings are guns, body armor, ammo, grenades, anything to destroy your enemy.
     The larger town you go to, the more weapons you will find, because usually more people go to the higher
     populated areas to get better weapons. Now once you get your weapons, shoot a few people, get a vehicle
     you may notice a giant purple wall closing in on you on your map, that is the area of restriction. If you
     step inside the area of restriction, you will slowly start taking damage and die, the way you avoid this, is
     to head to the play area, a white circle labeled on your map. You will usually have a few minutes to get to this
     play area before the area of restriction begins to close in.</p>

  <p>The game is also unique because you can customize your guns. Throughout the match, you will
     find gun attachments, like scopes, larger magazines, suppresors, and all sorts of other attachments that your can place
     on your guns.</p>

  <p>The goal of this game is to be the last man standing and to get recieve the "winner-winner-
    chicken-dinner" screen saying you have won, however, you dont have to win alone. In PUBG, you can play with a partner
     of your choice, or join a que to play with a random player, you can also play in a squad of 3-4 players of your choice,
     or a squad of completely random people!</p>

   of 2017. The game currently costs 30 dollars, however the price might go back up to 60 dollars soon so best get it now!</p>
