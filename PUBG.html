<h1 style="color:Yellow;">Backround</h1> 
<p style="color:White;"><b>PlayerUnkown's BattleGrounds or PUBG is a TPS(Third-Person-Shooter) and was released on March 23, 2017 by<br>
  Bluehole. Inc, and has been an instant success, with currently over 19.5 million players, PUBG has<br>
  the most downloads on Steam<br> (a gaming platform for pc), has a five star rating, and can be played<br>
  endlessly. PUBG is a king of the hill battle royale and was one of the first of its kind in the now<br>
  booming Battle Royale gaming establishment. The game unfortuanantly has no lore behind it, but it is<br>
  the realistic game-play and the unique-ness of it that makes it an absolute blast to play.</b></p>
  
  <h2 style="color:Yellow;">The Game</h2>
  <p style="color:White;"><b>At the start of every PUBG game, you start in a plane with 100 other players, that is flying over<br>
     a reasonabley sized island, this is your battle field. Across the island there are several deserted<br>
    towns and buildings.</b></p>
   <img src="NMG888.github.io/images/PUBG_map.jpg" style="width:450px;height:400px;">
     <p style="color:White;"><b>In the buildings are guns, body armor, ammo, grenades, anything to destroy your enemy.<br>
     The larger town you go to, the more weapons you will find, because usually more people go to the higher<br>
     populated areas to get better weapons. Now once you get your weapons, shoot a few people, get a vehicle<br>
     you may notice a giant purple wall closing in on you on your map, that is the area of restriction. If you<br>
     step inside the area of restriction, you will slowly start taking damage and die, the way you avoid this, is<br>
     to head to the play area, a white circle labeled on your map. You will usually have a few minutes to get to this<br>
     play area before the area of restriction begins to close in.</b></p>

  <p style="color:White;"><b>The game is also unique because you can customize your guns. Throughout the match, you will<br>
     find gun attachments, like scopes, larger magazines, suppresors, and all sorts of other attachments that your can place<br>
     on your guns.</b></p>
