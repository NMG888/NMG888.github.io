  <h3 style="color:Orange;">Closing Thoughts</h3>
  <p style="color:White;"><b>Team Fortress 2, like Overwatch has core game modes, which are payload, control points, attack and<br>
    defense, and capture the flag. Each game mode has its own set of maps and cool features that make it special! In TF2 there<br>
    are 9 classes you can play as. Those 9 classes have a weapon loadout where you can mix and match the weapons to make the<br>
    perfect combo.</b></p>

    and is faster than the rest of the cast, however has the least amount of health(125). The scout fights with his large<br>
     array of scatter guns, secondary weapons, and melees.</b></p>

  <p style="color:White;"><b>The second class in TF2 is the soldier, the soldier is an all american man, who uses his rocket<br>
     launcher to blast opponents and to propel him around the map, variety of secondary weapons, like shotguns, parachutes,<br>
    and team buffs. His melees are kind of mediocore, however his variety of weapons and mobility make him by far the most<br>
    unique and probably best class.</b></p>
  <p style="color:White;"><b>The third class in TF2 is the Pyro a genderless character who uses his flamethrowers, variety of secondaries,<br>
    and unique melees. The pyro succeeds in enclose areas with lots of people, considering he burns anything within range of the flamethrowers.</b></p>
   <p style="color:White;"><b>The fourth class is the Demoman, a drunk scott who uses grenade launchers, stickybomb launchers, and SWORDS with massive<br>
     damage output to destroy his opponets. The demoman again succeeds in enclose areas , where he can set up traps with his sticky bombs, and bounce grenades<br>
     off walls to hit enemies.
      </b></p>
  <p style="color:White;"><b>The fifth class is the heavy by far one of the funniest characters, the heavy is a large russian man who loves his minigun like<br>
    a wife.</b></p>
