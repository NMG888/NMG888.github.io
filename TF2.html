<br><h1>Backround</h1> 
<p>Team Fortress 2 or TF2 was made by Valve and released for the Orange Box(a console) and for steam on
  the computer on october 10, 2007. TF2 is another team based shooter, and currently has about 50 - 60 thousand people who play
  it actively, however on release over 5 million people played it! In tf2 you play as a team of mercenaries, hired by two brothers. 
  However, each brother wants the other dead, so the mercenaries are sent to damage the other teams base, supplies, and take control.</p>
  
  <h1>The Game</h1>
 <p>Team Fortress 2, like Overwatch has core game modes, which are payload, control points, attack and
    defense, and capture the flag. Each game mode has its own set of maps and cool features that make it special! In TF2 there
    are 9 classes you can play as. Those 9 classes have a weapon loadout where you can mix and match the weapons to make the
    perfect combo.</p>
    <img src="NMG888.github.io/images/loadout.jpg"style="width:450px;height:255px;">
    <p>The first character is the scout, a fast and mobile character who has the ability to double 
    and is faster than the rest of the cast, however has the least amount of health(125). The scout fights with his large
     array of scatter guns, secondary weapons, and melees.</p>
    <img src="NMG888.github.io/images/Scout_loadout.jpg"style="width:450px;height:255;">
  <p>The second class in TF2 is the soldier, the soldier is an all american man, who uses his rocket
     launcher to blast opponents and to propel him around the map, variety of secondary weapons, like shotguns, parachutes,
    and team buffs. His melees are kind of mediocore, however his variety of weapons and mobility make him by far the most
    unique and probably best class.</p>
    <img src="NMG888.github.io/images/Soldier_loadout.jpg"style="width:450px;height:255;">
  <p>The third class in TF2 is the Pyro a genderless character who uses his flamethrowers, variety of secondaries,
    and unique melees. The pyro succeeds in enclose areas with lots of people, considering he burns anything within range of the flamethrowers.</p>

   <p>The fourth class is the Demoman, a drunk scott who uses grenade launchers, stickybomb launchers, and SWORDS with massive
     damage output to destroy his opponets. The demoman again succeeds in enclose areas , where he can set up traps with his sticky bombs, and bounce grenades
     off walls to hit enemies.
      </p>

  <p>The fifth class is the heavy by far one of the funniest characters, the heavy is a large russian man who loves his minigun like
    a wife. Along with his many different miniguns, he has very unique secondary weapons, and melees. The heavy also boasts the most amount of health in
    the game(300 health), however, he is also the sloweset character.</p>
       <img src="NMG888.github.io/images/Heavy_Loadout.png"style="width:450px;height:255;">
  <p>The sixth class is the engineer who happens to be my favorite character, the engineer is a southern man, and can build buildings to aid
    his team. His first buidling is called a sentry, which as you may have guessed, kills the enemy, it can be upgraded 3 times aswell. The first upgrade is kind of bad
    but when you get that level 3 sentry, it rips through your enemy. The engineer also builds a dispenser, which heals you and gives you more ammo, which can also be upgraded
    to produce more health and ammo. His last building is the teleporter which can teleport your teammates to the front lines. The engineer also has his weapons,
    which usually consist of a shotgun and his secondary weapon.</p>
    <img src="NMG888.github.io/images/Engineer_loadout.png"style="width:450px;height:255;">
  <p>The seventh class of the TF2 cast is the medic, the medic is a german doctor who lost his license do to...."experiments".... and since then
    has supported the Team fortress teams everysince. The medic uses the medi-gun to heal and buff your teammates. The medi-gun also has what is called an uber charge
    the uber charge effect depends on the medi-gun, the original medi-gun makes you and the teammate your healing invincible for a certain amount of time.</p>
    <img src="NMG888.github.io/images/Medic_loadout.jpg"style="width:450px;height:255;">
  <p>The eighth class of TF2 is the sniper, and as you may have guessed, he uses a sniper rifle. He also has a variety of secondaries,
    his melees are kind of bad the sniper thrives on low health low mobility characters, for they are easing pickings.</p>
    <img src="NMG888.github.io/images/Sniper_loadout.jpg"style="width:450px;height:255;">
  <p>The nineth class of TF2 and probably one of the hardest to play, is the spy. The spy like the scout has the least amount of health,
    but has the unique ability to kill anyone with one hit in the back with his butterfly knife, and can turn invisible with his invisi-watches.
    The spy also has a revolver but they are kind of bad. The Spy also has the ability to disguise as the enemy team with his disguise kit.
    The spy thrives on paranoia and unaware players.</p>

  <h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
  <p>TF2 is a great game with a great cast, even though it's old, it's still a good game with its variety of weapons, characters, and maps.
    The best part about this game is it is totally free to play however there are in game purchases, mainly for cosmetics. So you can get
    every weapon free!</p>
