<h1 style="color:Orange;">Backround</h1> 
<p style="color:White;"><b>Team Fortress 2 or TF2 was made by Valve and released for the Orange Box(a console) and for steam on<br>
  the computer on october 10, 2007. TF2 is another team based shooter, and currently has about 50 - 60 thousand people who play<br>
  it actively, however on release over 5 million people played it! In tf2 you play  </b></p>
  
  <h2 style="color:Orange;">The Game</h2>
 <p style="color:White;"><b>Team Fortress 2, like Overwatch has core game modes, which are payload, control points, attack and<br>
    defense, and capture the flag. Each game mode has its own set of maps and cool features that make it special! In TF2 there<br>
    are 9 classes you can play as. Those 9 classes have a weapon loadout where you can mix and match the weapons to make the<br>
    perfect combo.</b></p>
    <img scr="NMG888.github.io/images/loadout.jpg"style="width:450px;height:255px;">
    <p style="color:White;"><b>The first character is the scout, a fast and mobile character who has the ability to double<br> 
    and is faster than the rest of the cast, however has the least amount of health(125). The scout fights with his large<br>
     array of scatter guns, secondary weapons, and melees.</b></p>
    <img scr="NMG888.github.io/images/Scout_loadout.jpg"style="width:450px;height:255;">
  <p style="color:White;"><b>The second class in TF2 is the soldier, the soldier is an all american man, who uses his rocket<br>
     launcher to blast opponents and to propel him around the map, variety of secondary weapons, like shotguns, parachutes,<br>
    and team buffs. His melees are kind of mediocore, however his variety of weapons and mobility make him by far the most<br>
    unique and probably best class.</b></p>
  <p style="color:White;"><b>The third class in TF2 is the Pyro a genderless character who uses his flamethrowers, variety of secondaries,<br>
    and unique melees. The pyro succeeds in enclose areas with lots of people, considering he burns anything within range of the flamethrowers.</b></p>
   <p style="color:White;"><b>The fourth class is the Demoman, a drunk scott who uses grenade launchers, stickybomb launchers, and SWORDS with massive<br>
     damage output to destroy his opponets. The demoman again succeeds in enclose areas , where he can set up traps with his sticky bombs, and bounce grenades<br>
     off walls to hit enemies.
      </b></p>
  <p style="color:White;"><b>The fifth class is the heavy by far one of the funniest characters, the heavy is a large russian man who loves his minigun like<br>
    a wife. Along with his many different miniguns, he has very unique secondary weapons, and melees. The heavy also boasts the most amount of health in<br>
    the game(300 health), however, he is also the sloweset character.</b></p>
  <p style="color:White;"><b>The sixth class is the engineer who happens to be my favorite character, the engineer is a southern man, and can build buildings to aid<br>
    his team. His first buidling is called a sentry, which as you may have guessed, kills the enemy, it can be upgraded 3 times aswell. The first upgrade is kind of bad<br>
    but when you get that level 3 sentry, it rips through your enemy. The engineer also builds a dispenser, which heals you and gives you more ammo, which can also be upgraded<br>
    to produce more health and ammo. His last building is the teleporter which can teleport your teammates to the front lines. The engineer also has his weapons,<br>
    which usually consist of a shotgun and his secondary weapon.</b></p>
  <p style="color:White;"><b>The seventh class of the TF2 cast is the medic, the medic is a german doctor who lost his license do to...."experiments".... and since then<br>
    has supported the Team fortress teams everysince. The medic uses the medi-gun to heal and buff your teammates. The medi-gun also has what is called an uber charge<br>
    the uber charge effect depends on the medi-gun, the original medi-gun makes you and the teammate your healing invincible for a certain amount of time.</b></p>
