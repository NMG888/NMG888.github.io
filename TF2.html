  <p style="color:White;"><b>Team Fortress 2, like Overwatch has core game modes, which are payload, control points, attack and<br>
    defense, and capture the flag. Each game mode has its own set of maps and cool features that make it special! In TF2 there<br>
    are 9 classes you can play as. Those 9 classes have a weapon loadout where you can mix and match the weapons to make the<br>
    perfect combo.</b></p>
